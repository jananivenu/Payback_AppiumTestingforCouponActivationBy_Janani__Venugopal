AppiumTesting for Paybackapp Installation and Coupon selection and activation

this project contains the following Automation flow of  Payback App:

The scenario is a user freshly installed the app, he/she logins and
navigates to the Coupon Center, filters the coupons by partner (he/she
preferred partner is REWE) and after that he/she activate the first
enabled Coupon.



I have used the below tech stack to execute the flow.
-Gradle BuildTool
-Cucumber BDD framework (gherkin framework)
-Selenium and Appium (Latest version 1.22) for Automating the Android app
-Java as the coding language.
-Kindly TestRunner.class to run the feature file which will execute the above mentioned flow.
-Cucumber reports are generated in the /target folder,after execution

Note:I could not automate the Login Page due to the security issues faced while inspecting the app.Hence,I have skipped the part.
